## About Mob Killer Count?
Mob Killer Count uses TalesWeaver 's Chatlog to calculate the amount of the monster' s subjugation, the total acquisition experience, and the acquisition experience value of 1 hour since the hunt started with a file drop.  
The copyright of TalesWeaver is located in NEXON CORPORATION, and this project has nothing to do with NEXON.

## Usage
1. TalesWeaver's option checks items in the chat log  
2. Confirm that HTML file is created in Chatolog folder of TalesWeaver 
(The default for the Chatlog folder is C: \ Nexon \ TalesWeaver \ ChatLog)  
3. Drop the HTML file in mob.html
(Do not change the file name of the chat log to drop)
